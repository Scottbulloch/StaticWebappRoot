# Snow Atlas Beta API resources

Snow Atlas is a cloud-native technology intelligence platform providing Snow products as SaaS solutions.

Snow Atlas has APIs that use standard HTTP methods. They serve as an intermediary that enables seamless data exchange and functionality integration between diverse systems, enabling Snow Atlas customers to access specific features or data from a remote service or application. You can use any REST client to communicate with the Snow Atlas REST service.

These APIs are under active development, and more functionality is being added with each product release. For information on how to get started with the Snow Atlas APIs, see [Get started with APIs](get-started-with-apis/index.md).
