# Authentication using Postman

Snow Atlas supports authentication with OAuth2 directly in Postman to get an access token to use with Snow Atlas APIs.

Access tokens that you retrieve using this client do not require any scope configuration. The permissions associated with the retrieved token reflect those of the user who configures Postman as described below.

## Configure Postman

Follow these steps to configure Postman to start an authorization flow.

1. In Postman, open a new request and select the **Authorization** tab.

2. For **Type**, select **OAuth 2.0**.

3. For **Add authorization data to**, select **Request Headers**.

4. In **Configure New Token**, in **Token Name**, enter a name for the token, for example, Snow Atlas.
