# Get started with APIs

This guide is intended to provide a basic overview of how the Snow Atlas APIs operate and how you can use them in your environment.

The Snow Atlas API provides an interface to interact programmatically with your Snow Atlas installation using the language or tool of your choice. This allows you to automate repetitive tasks or create scripts to simplify complex, multi-step actions.
